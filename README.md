# R_project NBA FAN TWEETS
This project is about Text Analytics with Natural Processing Language on R. Specifically I was tasked to analyze millions of tweets regarding the Call of Duty League, filtered and grouped by tweets by fans and from the official accounts of the teams. I chose to analyze the tweets of two competing teams from the same city (Los Angeles) that have a significant difference in number of followers and wanted to analyze how the audience reacted to their games and analyze their sentiments.


The code is divided into four main parts

1) Importing Libraries
2) Data cleaning - focusing on specific words that filter out unnecessary topics ("stopwords")
3) Organizing the data through matrixes to create plots later on
4) Creating Plots (word cloud, most frequent words, sentiment analysis)
